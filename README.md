The First Steps tutorial project contains a series of small sample scenes, each one demonstrating one or more features of coherence.  
After downloading this Unity project, we suggest to open up the [documentation](https://docs.coherence.io/learning-coherence/first-steps-tutorial) as it's the perfect companion to explore the scenes included in the project.

### Unity version
Currently the project is on Unity `2021.3.18f1`. You can open it with newer `2021.3` LTS patches or with `2022.3` LTS.  
Opening the project with Unity `2022.1` or `2022.2` is discouraged, due to a Unity bug. The bug was fixed in `2022.3` LTS.

## Additional resources

### Direct download
You can download the project using the Code button on this repo, as this project doesn't require LFS Support. Or fetch a release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/coherence/first-steps-tutorial/releases).

### Documentation
Full documentation for this project is available in [its own section](https://docs.coherence.io/learning-coherence/first-steps-tutorial) of the coherence documentation.

### Trying a pre-made build
