The First Steps tutorial project contains a series of small sample scenes, each one demonstrating one or more features of coherence.
After downloading this Unity project, we suggest to open up the [documentation](https://docs.coherence.io/learning-coherence/first-steps-tutorial) as it's the perfect companion to explore the scenes included in the project.

### Unity version
Currently the project is on Unity `2021.3.11f1`,  but opening it with any Unity `2021.3` version is fine.  
Note: At the moment of writing, opening the project with Unity `2022.1` or more recent is discouraged, due to a Unity bug. We are awaiting a fix and will update this.

## Additional resources

### Direct download
A .zip download of the project is available [here](https://bit.ly/coherenceFirstStepsPreview). Generally, you can also download it using the Code button on this repo, as this project doesn't require LFS Support.

### Documentation
Full documentation for this project is available at https://docs.coherence.io/learning-coherence/first-steps-tutorial

### Trying a pre-made build
To quickly try a pre-built version of the game, head to [this link](https://coherence.io/games/coherence/first-steps-tutorial) and either play the WebGL build in the browser, or download one of the available desktop versions.
