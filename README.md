# coherence First Steps - Tutorial project

![](https://imgur.com/ocYS3LD.jpg)

The First Steps project is a series of small sample scenes, each one demonstrating one or more features of coherence.
After downloading the code here, we suggest to open up the [documentation](https://docs-coherence.gitbook.io/first-steps/) as the perfect companion to explore the different scenes included in the project.

### Unity version
Currently the project is on Unity `2021.3.11f1`,  but opening it with any Unity `2021.3` version is fine.

## Additional resources

### Direct download
A .zip download of the project is available [here](https://bit.ly/coherenceFirstStepsPreview). Generally, you can also download it using the Code button on this repo, as this project doesn't require LFS Support.

### Documentation
Full documentation for this project is available at https://docs-coherence.gitbook.io/first-steps/  
Main coherence docs are available at https://docs.coherence.io
