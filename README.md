Welcome! This is a tutorial project to take your first steps in [coherence](https://coherence.io), a framework for networking in Unity.

First Steps contains a collection of small scenes, each one demonstrating one or more features of coherence.  
After downloading this Unity project, we suggest to open up the [documentation](https://docs.coherence.io/learning-coherence/first-steps-tutorial) as it's the perfect companion to explore the scenes included in the project.

### Topics covered
- Basic syncing of variables
- Messaging with Network Commands (RPCs)
- Networking animation
- Networking complex hierarchies
- Spatial queries and optimisation
- Using persistent world data

### Unity version
Currently the project is on Unity `2021.3.27f1`. You can open it with newer `2021.3` LTS patches or with `2022.3` LTS.  
Opening the project with Unity `2022.1` or `2022.2` is discouraged, due to a Unity bug. The bug was fixed in `2022.3` LTS.

## Additional resources

### Direct download
You can download the project using the Code button on this repo, as this project doesn't require LFS Support. Or fetch a release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/coherence/first-steps-tutorial/releases).

### Documentation
Full documentation for this project is available as part of the [coherence documentation](https://docs.coherence.io/learning-coherence/first-steps-tutorial).

### Trying a pre-made build
Check out the game on the [coherence Cloud](https://coherence.io/games/coherence/first-steps-tutorial) and either play the WebGL version of the game directly in your browser, or download one of the available desktop versions.

(note: we recommend Chrome, other browsers can have problems with Unityâ€™s WebGL)
